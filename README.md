This repository is mainly for R related scripts to extract, aggregate, and analyze climate data. Primarily the two main datasets we are using are the CMIP5 1/8 degree (12km x 12km) data, and the ClimateNA data which is downscaled CMIP5 data (1km x 1km).

### Scripts

The data for CMIP5 were extracted from **netcdf** format and scripts are provided to extract and plot these data.
